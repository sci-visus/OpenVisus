Contributing
============

The zfp project uses the
[Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
development model.  Contributions should be made as pull requests on the
`develop` branch.  Although this branch is under continuous development,
it should be robust enough to pass all regression tests.  For contributions
that are not production ready, please [contact us](mailto:zfp.llnl.gov) to
have a separate branch created.  The `master` branch is updated with each
release and reflects the most recent official release of zfp.  See the
[Releases Page](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp/releases) for a history
of releases.
